# Web-scraping Python script that fetches manga chapters from manganelo

## To use the app:
Before anything, install both files and run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


Then run with ```py mangatracker.py``` and follow the prompts!


Side note: I made this a while back (about 3 years ago) and I recently discovered that the manganelo API is extremely slow
so it definitely takes some time to download chapters but it definitely still works (even if it is very janky)
