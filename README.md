# Web-scraping Python script that fetches manga chapters from manganelo

## To use the app:
Before anything, install both files and run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

In mangatracker.py:
Change the file path under the comments (#CHANGE FILE PATH BELOW) to a folder on your computer.

Then run with ```py mangatracker.py``` and follow the prompts!


Side note: I made this a while back (about 3 years ago) and it was just laying on my pc, so I decided to publish it
