## To use the app:
Before anything, install both files and run:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

In mangatracker.py:
Change the file path under the comments (#CHANGE FILE PATH BELOW) to a folder on your computer.

Then run and follow the prompts!
``py mangatracker.py``

Side note: I made this a while back (about 3 years ago) and it was just laying on my pc, so I decided to publish it
